# About Moseq Reports
Interactive interrogation of Moseq models
## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to democratizing moseq data to bring complex data as a result of modeling from coputational biologits into the hands of the wetlab researchers. Allows these researchers to easily understand this data without having to reference outside sources. This program reports data in a form which can be quickly understood by researchers who can use this data while providing a set of robust tools to format that data in their own way.
## Concepts
### What is Moseq
Motion sequencing
Record depth video of mice freely behaving in an arena
Break down depth video and label what the mice are doing (syllables)

### What are groups
