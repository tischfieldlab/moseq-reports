# Purpose
Moseq reports exists to democratize moseq data. Computational biologists often produce data which is difficult to parse without the proper context making it difficult for others to simply pick up and use. Moseq reports allows wetlab researchers to easily understand moseq models without having to reference outside sources. This program reports data in a form which can be quickly understood by researchers while also providing a set of robust tools to reformat that data in such a way that would be most beneficial to their research.
